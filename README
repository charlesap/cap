This is a README file for the Computer Applications Platform, 
which is meant to be a self-sustaining computing environment 
for commodity computers. The CAP system is intended to provide 
features corresponding to compilers, operating systems, and 
applications. 

         This is revision 0 of the software, 
          THE SYSTEM IS NOT YET FUNCTIONAL. 

See cap.pdf for an exploration of the systems goals, status, 
techniques, and implementation.

To bootstrap the system (as far as it is currently implemented) 
in a Unix environment with bash, sed, awk, python, place the files 
cap.i, cap.xtrfile.sh, and cap.xtrall.sh in a directory, make the 
shell scripts executable, and then execute cap.xtrall.sh

After bootstrapping the system, if you have latex installed on your
host system you can execute the i2l.sh script to produce the cap.pdf file.
